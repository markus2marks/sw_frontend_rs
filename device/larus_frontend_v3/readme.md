This section contains the sources for the hardware adaptation to the Larus Frontend 57 V2 display. If you want to develop or compile the sources yourself, you will need the following:
- You must first [install the Rust environment](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). 
- Then you will [enable support for the embedded hardware](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/install.html). You will need the Cortex M4F and Cortex M7F architecture ($ rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf).
- It is recommended to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a development environment. You will also need the plugins CodeLLDB, Cortex-Debug, rust-analyzer.
- If you want to use the make_image.sh script, you must first create a virtual Python environment under .venv  in the project root directory. Install the Python libraries `pyelftools` and `toml` here.
