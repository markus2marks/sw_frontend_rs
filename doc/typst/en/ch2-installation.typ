#tr[To make it easier to identify the pins, these numbers are also engraved on the socket (included
in the scope of delivery). Once the wiring is complete, the settings must be configured in the LARUS Vario display
.

Meaning of the pin labels:
  - Ground: Connected to negative
  - Input: Input for a switch (open or closed)
  - Output: Output is opened/closed by the display

The Input and Output pin functions must be configured accordingly; see @settings.]

=== #hr[Audio] 

#tr[An audio socket is provided for connecting a speaker with a 3.5 mm jack plug.
The speaker’s impedance must be between 4 and 8 Ω (maximum output of 3
W at 4 Ω).]

#picnote("/img/pictograph-yellow-warning.svg")[
    #tr[A single speaker must not be connected to more than one device.]

=== #hr[SD Card]

#tr[The device has an SD card slot for firmware updates.]

#picnote("/img/pictograph-yellow-warning.svg")[
    #tr[As SD card extensions may damage the LARUS Vario Display, we 
    accept no liability for any damage resulting from their use.]
]

=== #hr[Cabling]

#tr[When a serial connection (RS232) is established between the SteFly NAV and the LARUS Vario Display,
the MC settings, for example, are synchronised/transferred between the devices.
In addition, the LARUS Vario Display processes inputs from a Speed-to-Fly/Vario switch
which is connected directly to the SteFly remote control stick. The following steps are
required:

- Connecting devices with a cable:
  - The CAN port of the LARUS sensor unit must be connected to the CAN port of the 
    LARUS Vario Display using a 1:1 patch cable (in two-seater configurations, using the cable box).
  - Devices running XCSoar can be connected via a crossed RX/TX patch cable between the 
    RS232 port of the Vario display and the ttySx port of the SteFly NAV.
- Optionally, connect switches for detecting the release of water ballast and the 
  landing gear warning to the corresponding DSUB-9-pin and any GND pin. For the 
  landing gear warning, you have the option of using two separate, directly connected switches for 
  the landing gear and the airbrakes (recommended) or a cable with both 
  switches connected in series to the DSUB-9 connector.
- The SteFly remote control stick can be connected in two different ways:
  - Depending on the configuration: using a separate cable to DSUB-9 pin 7
  - Using the USB cable (always available)
- Please adjust the settings in XCSoar (version 7.44 or higher) / OpenSoar (7.43 or 
  higher): If the Vario display is connected directly to the SteFly NAV, please select the 
  corresponding ttyS port, baud rate 38400, Larus driver, and enable synchronisation (option) with 
  the device.
- Please adjust the settings in the LARUS Vario Display for the connected optional 
  switches.
  - Landing gear warning
  - Water ballast
  - Configuration of the speed to fly switch (if not switched automatically):
    - Input pin: To use an external switch (on the control stick, flap lever, etc.), 
      set the Vario control to “Input pin” and select the correct setting       
      in the StF pin configuration. (active: when open/closed)
    - NMEA for SteFly remote control stick. In addition to the settings in the Vario, you must 
      install an event definition file in XCSoar/OpenSoar (Configuration / System / 
      View / Language, Input / Events – enable Expert, click on Events – 
      Download – GLB-XCI-xcremote-XCNAV.xci). Exit the XCSoar configuration and 
      restart XCSoar.]

== #hr[CAN Termination]

#tr[The LARUS Vario Display and the LARUS sensor unit are connected to each other via the CAN bus.
CAN bus networks require terminating resistors at each end of the network. Therefore, all
devices have a built-in switch to activate the resistor:]

])

#tr[Please note: All LARUS sensor units delivered before March 2025 do not have
a CAN terminator. The CAN terminator resistors are always enabled by default.]

== #hr[External Backup]

#picnote("/img/pictograph-yellow-warning.svg")[
    #tr[The LARUS Vario Display is usually powered via a
    patch cable connected between the LARUS CAN ports. LARUS must be protected by an
    external fuse (500 mA to max. 3 A), as is standard practice for all electrical equipment
    in aviation. If LARUS draws its power from another primary instrument
    (e.g. SteFly NAV via D-Sub connector), please ensure that the primary instrument is
    protected by an external fuse.]

#tr[To install it, you will need to remove the two knobs using a
1.5 mm hex key.]

== #hr[Installation Orientation]

#picnote("/img/pictograph-blue-cloud.svg")[
    #tr[If you intend to replace an existing device with the LARUS
    Vario Display, please check the desired mounting position before drilling the
    7.3 mm hole for the encoder, as the display housing is slightly asymmetrical.]
]

#tr[The display can be mounted at angles of 0°, 90°, 180° or 270°. Once the display has been mounted,
its orientation may need to be adjusted in the ‘Display Rotation’ menu.]

== #hr[Initial Commissioning and Functional Test]

#tr[To set up the system, please follow these steps:

+ Please check that the LARUS Vario Display is connected as shown in the diagrams in  
  @system-configurations. 
+ Switch on the LARUS.
+ Please check that the LARUS Vario Display starts up and a yellow or green 
  satellite icon is displayed. The Vario indicators should show slight movements around the
  zero position.
+ You should now configure the device. All configuration options are documented in detail in the 
  settings chapter.]

== #hr[Maintenance] 

#tr[The entire system contains no parts that require maintenance. To make a claim under the warranty, 
please contact SteFly directly.]

#picnote("/img/pictograph-yellow-warning.svg")[
    #tr[Opening the casing of the LARUS Vario display will invalidate the warranty.]
]

== #hr[Firmware Update]

#tr[The LARUS team is constantly improving the software and releasing firmware updates. To
update the firmware, proceed as follows:

+ Switch off the device.
+ Save the new \*.bin file to the SD card supplied with the device and insert 
  it into the SD card slot on the back of the LARUS Vario Display.
+ Switch on the device.
+ When firmware is detected on the SD card, the display will remain black for approximately 3–5 seconds 
  before the message “#keep[Installing... Do NOT power off device]” appears.
+ The device will restart automatically. During the first 10 seconds, the firmware version will be displayed in the Info1 area
 .

The LARUS Vario Display will only install compatible firmware versions. If multiple firmware 
versions are stored on the card, the latest one will be installed.

If the installation fails, please repeat the process. If the
installation fails again, please use a different SD card. The SD card must
have a capacity of at least 4 GB (SDHC type) and be formatted with FAT32. The format must be compatible with
DOS/Windows 95 (not GPT).]
